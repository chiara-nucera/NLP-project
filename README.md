In order for this project to work, it is necessary to create an additional folder called Data and insert there the 
downloaded dataset: the FEVER (Pre-processed Wikipedia Pages (June 2017 dump) and Training Dataset from https://fever.ai/dataset/fever.html) 
and the Hotpotqa datasets (https://hotpotqa.github.io/)
